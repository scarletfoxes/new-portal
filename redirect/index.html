  <h1>If you're viewing this page, you know the struggle.</h1>
    <p>We understand that the page you were trying to access is very important. You either owe us lots of money or you need to gain access to the library, student employment, or some other very important screen that we've made extremely difficult to access.</p>
    <p>The more important things is that you make sure you add or drop all the classes you need in order to get through the semester. So, even if you need to do something more important, we encourage you to click <a href="../class-schedule/index.html">here</a> to get your schedule ready for next semester!</p>
    <!--<p> Unforutnately, only one page is actually accessible. While we do understand that you may need to pay bills or get an on campus job from time to time, the more important things is that you make sure you add or drop all the classes you need in order to get through the semester. So, even if you need to do something more important, we encourage you to click   <a href="../class-schedule/index.html">here</a> to get your schedule ready for next semester!</p>-->
