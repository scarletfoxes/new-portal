Project 2 for Human Computer Intereaction: A redesign of the MyIIT Portal

Erin Baxter: Hi, I think my strengths are mainly basic html and also grid/baselines in css. Also if ask me for help I will try and answer as soon as possible.

Ore Olotu: Hey y'all. I'm pretty good with html and css (color and design). I know a bit of javascript and open to learning new things!

Antoine Foggs: Hola! So, I enjoy HTML and I like designing the entire functionality of a webpage, as well as the layout. I'm pretty busy, but if you need me to do something, just let me know and it will get done. I also tend to do things either really early or at the very last minute, so let's be all be early together!

Stephen Grzenia: yo, I would consider my strengths as the following; 1) I don't like to cause trouble in groups. If you want to do something and it isn't detremental to the project or just 100% incorrect, I support you. 2) My communication skills within groups. 3) When it comes down to the wire I will push everything aside to finish something(in this case, this project). 4) I guess I'm alright at HTML structure and being semantic and stuff. CSS isn't bad.


For our project, we will focus on redesigning the add/drop function of the MyIIT Portal. The primary pages that we will need to focus on will be as follows:
  Login page
  Main page
  Add/Drop page
  Class list page

Our model will ensure that the page is mobile-friendly and that it can be accessed and classes can be added and dropped easily. For simplification, we will not add detailed data regarding the classes, as the MyIIT webpage does let you schedule conflicting classes. The reason we choose not to focus on this is because we want to ensure a design that is easy to use and comprehend, leaving the more complicated work for a later time. The following is the primary layout for the portal.

The Login Page will only contain a section dedicated for allowing the user to log in, as well as a bit of design meant to represent the school. Any other information is unnecessary and would just be a waste of data that the user is forced to download.

Upon a successful Login, the user will see a greeting with their first and last name on the upper right portion of the screen. This will remain there only on the Main page, as it makes the overall experience a bit more personal and authentic. Listed on this page will be the primary pages that users would need to access. However, for the sake of our project, we will only include the key features of said pages: Check Grades, Add/Drop Class, Finances, Support. The users

Of these pages, only the Add/Drop class page will be functional. The rest will lead to a page that apologies to the user for MyIIT's terrible service.

The Add/Drop page will display the users Pin number at the top once the user clicks reveal, however every other feature of the page will be accessible. The only time the user will need that information is to verify their pin number before adding the class. Aside from this, the Add/Drop page will be more or less similar to the MyIIT page. However, there will be no CRN numbers. The user can scroll down to a different section of the web page to search for classes. Javascript will be used to insert whatever list of classes they need access too, and each class will have a unique ID for Javascript that will allow the user to simply click and verify which classes they want to take. Once the user selects their classes, Javascript will be used to insert it in their current class list. If the User decides that they don't want to have a class anymore, they will simply click Drop beside that class in order to have Javascript remove it and notify the user that the class has been successfully dropped.
