Project 2 for Human Computer Intereaction: A redesign of the MyIIT Portal

Erin Baxter: Hi, I think my strengths are mainly basic html and also grid/baselines in css. Also if ask me for help I will try and answer as soon as possible.

Antoine Foggs: Hola! So, I enjoy HTML and I like designing the entire functionality of a webpage, as well as the layout. I'm pretty busy, but if you need me to do something, just let me know and it will get done. I also tend to do things either really early or at the very last minute, so let's be all be early together!
